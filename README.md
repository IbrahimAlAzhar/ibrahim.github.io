### Research Experience
- Research Experience (Conference Paper)
- I. A. Azhar, S. Ahmed, M. S. Islam, and A. Khatun, ”Identifying Author in Bengali Literature by Bi‑LSTM with Attention Mechanism,”
  2021 24th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Dhaka, Bangladesh, 2021,
  pp. 1‑6, doi: 10.1109/ICCIT54785.2021.9689840.
- Description: Proposed a Bi‑LSTM model with a self‑attention mechanism by Glove embedding to identify the Author. Used Deep Learning models like CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and Fast text and showed
   proposed model outperforms.
  
### In Progress
- “Assessing the limitations sections in scientific article with LLM.”. Here, we extract the scientific article's limitations sections using a parsing tool. After extracting the limitation sections, we applied various LLMs for topic modeling GPT 3.5, GPT 4, Llama 2, and LLM for summarization.
- “Generate open review from the scholarly article.” Take the text from a scientific article and generate the open review using LLM.
- “Generate Limitations from the scholarly article.” Considering various sections and texts from scholarly articles and generating limitation sections using various LLMs and Retrieval Augmented Generation.
<!-- - “Design a scientific paper architecture/flowcharts from texts with LLM.” Take images with captions from scientific articles and train a vision language multimodal LLM. Then, take the caption and generate the flowcharts or architecture of the research paper. -->
• “Scientific Image as a Limitation.” We are working on images of scientific articles and using algorithms like
superpixels or other stuff to improve the quality.
- “Can LLM predict citations ?” Take the scientific article abstract and other information and predict the
citations using LLM.
- “Software vulnerability detection with LLM.” Take the code from various sources and check whether the code is
vulnerable or not.
<!-- “Instagram image captioning”. Take the images from Instagram, generate the caption using a vision transformer, and check the original caption as a ground truth. -->
