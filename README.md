  2021 24th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Dhaka, Bangladesh, 2021,
  pp. 1‑6, doi: 10.1109/ICCIT54785.2021.9689840.
- Description: The authorship attribution task is determining the author of an unknown text using one’s writing patterns. We
  propose Bi‑directional Long Short Term Memory(Bi‑LSTM) model with a self‑attention mechanism by Glove embedding
  where glove embedding preserves semantic and syntactic knowledge of words; BiLSTM incorporates the future and past
  context information; the attention mechanism gives lower weights to common words and higher weights to keywords.
  We used several Deep Learning models like CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, CNN + GRU, CNN + BiLSTM, and Fast text +
  CNN and showed that our proposed Glove + BiLSTM + Attention model outperforms by a significant margin.
