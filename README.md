- I. A. Azhar, S. Ahmed, M. S. Islam, and A. Khatun, ”Identifying Author in Bengali Literature by Bi‑LSTM with Attention Mechanism,”
  2021 24th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT), Dhaka, Bangladesh, 2021,
  pp. 1‑6, doi: 10.1109/ICCIT54785.2021.9689840.
- Description: The authorship attribution task is determining the author of an unknown text using one’s writing patterns. We
  propose Bi‑directional Long Short Term Memory(Bi‑LSTM) model with a self‑attention mechanism by Glove embedding
  where glove embedding preserves semantic and syntactic knowledge of words; BiLSTM incorporates the future and past
  context information; the attention mechanism gives lower weights to common words and higher weights to keywords.
  We used several Deep Learning models like CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, CNN + GRU, CNN + BiLSTM, and Fast text +
  CNN and showed that our proposed Glove + BiLSTM + Attention model outperforms by a significant margin.


### Projects
- Worked on one of the largest medical datasets, MIMIC IV. Predicting mortality, hospital length of stay
- Amazon Review Analysis: Using several data preprocessing steps to preprocess the data, various machine learning
and deep learning models are applied to classify the customer review for the product.
- Cats and Dogs classification: Using CNN bottleneck and building a model for cats vs. dogs classification from scratch. Applied
Graph ConvNet, Inception Network, CNN, LeNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, and VGG19 for classification purposes.
- Classification on IMDB, MNIST, Iris dataset: Used several Machine learning models such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Linear Regres‑
sion, Decision Tree, Ensemble Learning, and various deep learning models like CNN, RNN, GRU, and BiLSTM to classify.
- Online Newspaper: It is a web‑based project using Python, Django, and Javascript where anyone can read news with monthly
payment subscription.
- Apply CNN, LeNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet, VGG16, VGG19 model as well as transfer learning model on
image data
